# Simple Demo Web Interface

Using HTML, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript, jQuery

## Description

This Web Interface can be used for testing your testing tools and/or frameworks. 

Website exist of 3 HTML pages, with interactive components using integrated java script and several functions in the .js file. Besides the img folder contains a printscreen with an example bug.

Website contains several bugs on purpose. So you are able to see if your test framework is build in a robust way.

Examples:
- You want to see if all test scenario's are executed, even when some scenario's are failing. if your framework does not continue after it founds its first bug, you will loose costly time, you usaly don't want to wait for developers fixing the isue before you can find your next bug;
- See if the feedback of your framework is clear enough for you/your developing team mates. Think about console log, but as well reporting on the scenario's level.


## Installation

- clone this GIT folder to your local machine.

## Run

- For manual testing just open the index.html (from this page you can reach each functionality);
- For test automation purpopse use the reference to the same file <yourLocalFolderPath>/index.html.

Warning: it is quite easy to reach the no.html page, as the input field of the homepage is sensitive for upper/lower case, spaces, etc. Besides I was to lazy to add all current coleagues. If you know how to read the javascript file, you will find the cases which are valid in the first function, if you are not that familar with reading this files/functions, just use 'Andre' or 'Bert' (so starting with a capital letter, all other characters are lowercase).
